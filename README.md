# Multimodal Research and Technological Project

All experiments were done to classify multimodal data. These experiments are the results produced by the model: https://github.com/Damorgal/Biprojection-Multimodal-Transformer

This includes: 

* ***Moviescope:*** Dataset for movie genre classification: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03180
    
* ***MM-IMDb:*** Dataset for movie genre classification: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01992
    
* ***IEMOCAP:*** Dataset for emotion detection: https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/
    
* ***CMU_MOSEI:*** Dataset for emotion detection and sentiment intensity: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/papers/dap2018_mosei.pdf

A first report was done before our research. It can be find in the TechnologicalProject file.
